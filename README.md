# Space Saving Algorithm

Implementing the space saving algorithm specified [here](http://romania.amazon.com/techon/presentations/DataStreamsAlgorithms_FlorinManolache.pdf).

The space saving algorithm is a way to count a large quanity of data in an efficient way. It is faster but it is not 100% accurate. In this project a traditional counting method in created along with the space saving method. 

Here we count the most common words and langauges used in tweets. The tweets were collected from the Twitter API over 4 day.
